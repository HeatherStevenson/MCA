	  <p> Week 1: Musical Datasets
1.	Identify a theme for your dataset. This will be the central, cohesive strand that will bring your data together. It can be an artist, composer, songwriter, performer, album, larger work (i.e. opera, musical, etc.), time period, genre, archival grouping, etc. You will want to be sure that you can gather all three types of data based on your selected theme.
•	The theme of the dataset is the music of Bastille. 
2. Describe the current manifestations of data relating to your selected theme. Has it already been
         curated somewhere? How is the data presented, described, and analysed?

The sheet music is described by song titles, creator of the sheet music, number of parts, number of pages; dates created and are accompanied by an image of the sheet music. You can search for specific songs and filter by instrument. You can also sort the results by upload date, comment count, relevance and view count. The results are analysed by the number of views. 
•	Acoustic Data- The recorded music such as vinyl or CD has been curated by album or single. They are accompanied by album artwork, and have also have a booklet inside the inner sleeve which has lyrics and images for the album. It also contains photographs and information about the album such as who wrote the songs and photos showing the creation of the album. On the vinyl themselves there is information on the publisher of the album, the name of the album/artist and the side of the album eg Wild World by Bastille has sides A-D.
